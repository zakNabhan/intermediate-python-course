""" 
For the input of your function, you will be given one sentence. You have to return a corrected version, that starts with a capital letter and ends with a period (dot).

Pay attention to the fact that not all of the fixes are necessary. If a sentence already ends with a period (dot), then adding another one will be a mistake.

Input: A string.

Output: A string.

Example:
correct_sentence("greetings, friends") == "Greetings, friends."
correct_sentence("Greetings, friends") == "Greetings, friends."
correct_sentence("Greetings, friends.") == "Greetings, friends."
